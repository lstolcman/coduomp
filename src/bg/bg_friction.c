// PM_Friction — the CoD:UO pmove velocity-friction step (Quake3
// movement.c PM_Friction lineage). Operates on the global pmove context
// pm (0x30539850): move = pm, ps = move->ps.
//
// NAME ADJUDICATION: the .mcode header guesses "vectoangles" by size
// (win 0x15e == corpus 0x15e). That is REJECTED: this body performs no angle
// math whatsoever — it reads playerState velocity, forms a speed, accumulates a
// friction "drop", and rescales velocity. That is exactly PM_Friction. The
// same-module PPC bank lists a PM_Friction whose *size* (0x288) differs; per the
// worker contract sizes do not correspond across builds and are ignored — the
// name is adopted from proven behavior, not size.
//
// ABI: __cdecl, no source arguments (all state comes from the global pmove
// context). The SUB ESP,8 frame holds two 4-byte float spill locals at [ESP+8]
// (`speed`) and [ESP+0xc] (`control` / scratch). Plain RET; PUSH/POP EBX,ESI are
// register preservation.
//
// x87 note: the whole body is x87 stack arithmetic. Each C expression below is
// written to preserve the exact instruction order, operand widths (all single-
// precision float loads/stores), and the fcom/fnstsw/test-ah/jp compare idiom.
// A `TEST AH,0x5 ; JP taken` after `FCOM/FCOMP mem` means "ST0 >= mem" (parity of
// C0|C2 is even for greater/equal/unordered-none; odd only for the less-than
// case where C0=1); the JP-not-taken fall-through is the `ST0 < mem` branch.
